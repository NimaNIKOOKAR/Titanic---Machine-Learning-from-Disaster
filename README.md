# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢

Welcome to the **Titanic ML Competition** on Kaggle! This is your go-to place to practice your data science and machine learning skills with real-world data. Let’s get you started with the essentials.

---

## 📜 About the Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build a predictive model to answer the question:

> *What sorts of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?*

You’ll work with passenger data (name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.) to predict whether passengers survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic in 1912.

---

## 📂 Datasets

The competition provides two main datasets:

- **train.csv** – data for 891 passengers with survival status (`Survived` column: 0 = did not survive, 1 = survived).
- **test.csv** – data for 418 passengers, survival status to be predicted.

Additionally, there’s an **example submission** file: `gender_submission.csv`, to help format your predictions correctly.

---

## 📊 Submission Format

Your submission file (`submission.csv`) should have **exactly**:

| PassengerId | Survived |
|-------------|----------|
| 892         | 0        |
| 893         | 1        |
| ...         | ...      |

- **Two columns only**: `PassengerId` and `Survived`.
- **Exactly 418 rows** (1 per test passenger).

1. **Join the Competition**  
   Accept the rules and download the data from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

2. **Explore the Data**  
   Analyze the data in `train.csv` to discover patterns and insights.

3. **Build a Model**  
   Use libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any framework you prefer.

4. **Make Predictions**  
   Predict survival for the passengers in `test.csv`.

5. **Submit Your Predictions**  
   Go to the “Submit Predictions” section on Kaggle, upload your `submission.csv`, and see your score!
